Gauge gives you a business layer on top of your test scripts to make them more readable and more understandable.
Tests that are created using a business-like language.
Support for all kinds of platforms and languages and all this awesomeness is open-source!

Gauge is somewhat similar like the BDD (Cucumber - "https://cucumber.io/") but Gauge offers better maintanence of the code and even, non-technical people can also
understand what the test is all about. 
Gauge also allows you to create test “specifications” that are written in an English-like syntax, making tests easy to read and create.
